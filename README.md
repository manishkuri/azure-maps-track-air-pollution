Air pollution can be incredibly harmful to human and animal health, and is caused by a number of factors, both natural and artificial. Factory output, burning different types of fuel and natural wildfires all contribute to a rise in air pollution. This pollution is airborne, and won't stay where it was produced, but can be carried many kilometers across the globe by the wind. In late 2019, for example, the smoke from wildfires in Australia reached New Zealand, over 2,000 kilometers away.

Air pollution is measured using the Air Quality Index (AQI) on a scale from 0-500. The higher the level, the greater the health risk. AQI values under 50 means little to no risk, but values above 300 means the air is hazardous to everyone.

The Air Quality index looks at a few different pollutants:

- Ground-level ozone
- Particulates
- Carbon monoxide
- Sulphur dioxide
- Nitrogen dioxide
